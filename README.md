**Description:**
RandomMouseMover is an open-source script designed to prevent screen locking and maintain system activity by periodically moving the mouse cursor to random positions on the screen. This project offers a simple yet effective solution to prevent screen locking or system sleep due to inactivity. It is particularly useful for scenarios where continuous system activity is required, such as during presentations, demonstrations, or monitoring tasks.

**Features:**
- **Prevent Screen Locking:** RandomMouseMover prevents the screen from locking by simulating mouse movements at random intervals.
- **Start/Stop with Double-click:** Users can start the script by double-clicking on it. Double-clicking again will stop the script.
- **Customizable Interval:** Users can adjust the interval between mouse movements according to their preferences or specific requirements.
- **Easy to Use:** The script is easy to execute with a simple double-click, requiring no additional setup.
- **Lightweight:** RandomMouseMover is lightweight and consumes minimal system resources, ensuring smooth operation without impacting system performance.

**Usage:**
1. Double-click the RandomMouseMover script to start it.
2. To stop the script, double-click it again.
3. The script will run in the background, periodically moving the mouse cursor to random positions on the screen to prevent screen locking or system sleep due to inactivity.
